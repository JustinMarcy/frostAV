** I2C Arbitration
   It is expected that modules communicating on the wired bus will
   need to communicate with each-other. In this case, there would be
   multiple masters on a single i2c bus. To implement this,
   arbitration would be necessary so that masters on the bus do not
   interrupt each other.
