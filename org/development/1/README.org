* System Abstraction
** Abstract System Operation Description
   The Frost Autonomous Vehicle consists of a vehicle and a system for
   controlling the vehicle. The vehicle provides an interface mainly
   to move it and to steer it. Bridge Controllers handle the
   peripherals that make up the vehicle interface. Bridge Controllers
   cannot operate unless they have instructions. These instructions
   come from a wired-bus. Different types of modules can send
   instructions to the wired-bus. The most important modules are the
   Networker and each individual Sensor System. Sensor Systems provide
   feedback for the Bridge Controllers to act upon. Furthermore, the
   Networker transfers information between the wired-bus and the
   wireless-bus. The wireless-bus allows for communication with
   devices that are not on the vehicle itself. Overall, the abstract
   system provides a map for how information is received and directed
   towards the vehicle's interaction with the environment. 

   #+attr_latex: :width 0.8\linewidth :placement [H]
   #+caption: Fundamental module abstraction. Consists of a wired-bus for inter-communication between modules on the Frost vehicle, and a wireless-bus for communication with a server or an ssh client. Bridge Controllers act as the coupling between the vehicle and the modules that do not depend on the vehicle interface. 
   [[../figure/2019-09-16_AbstractSystem.png]]

** Bridge Controllers
   "Bridge" refers to a software design pattern from the Gang of Four,
   which intends to "decouple an abstraction from its implementation
   so that the two can vary independently." As such, the Bridge
   Controllers will have software that implements the Bridge design
   pattern, so that implementation code (for a specific vehicle) is
   decoupled from the system interface.

** Networker
   The Networker is reponsible for transfering information between the
   wireless-bus and the wired-bus.

** Sensor Systems 
   Various Sensor Systems may be added to the wired-bus. An individual
   Sensor System should receive information from a sensor, process the
   information, and send the result to the wired-bus.

** System Operation Description
   The PS3 Eye Camera provides visual information about the
   environment. This information will be processed with the OpenCV
   library on a Raspberry Pi 2 with an Arch ARM operating
   system. Processed camera information will then be piped through
   \(I^2C\) to the Bridge Controllers. The Servo Bridge Controller has
   a PWM output which directly drives the steering servo. The Motor
   Bridge Controller has a PWM output that is handled by the
   electronic speed controller (ESC), which drives the motor.

   Overall, this system operates in a feedback loop commonly
   illustrated similar to the figure below.

   #+attr_latex: :width 0.6\linewidth :placement [H]
   #+caption: A simple feedback loop for an autonomous car.

   #+caption: A concrete illustration of the feedback loop in figure [[fig:controlLoop]]
   [[../figure/2019-10-24_cameraToControl.png]]

** System Assumptions
  The assumption made in this development stage is that the motor
  speed and servo steering angle can be controlled individually, such
  that motor speed and steering angle do not require direct knowledge
  of each other. Hence, the arrows from the wired-bus to the Servo and
  Motor Bridge Controllers are unidirectional. This assumption is
  meant to simplify the \(I^2C\) wired-bus configuration - since
  bi-directional communication on this bus would require
  arbitration. 
** Bus Communication
   JSON will be used as the format for data for both the wireless and
   wired buses. JSON provides easy to understand data structure
   packets that can be serialized and sent as a stream. Using JSON
   sacrifices speed for readability and extendability of the system.

*** Wireless-Bus
   In this stage the wireless-bus should allow for an SSH
   client to connect to it. As such, JSON packets that would normally
   be sent to the wireless-bus, will instead be stored locally in
   the system, but will be callable from an SSH client. 

*** Wired-Bus
   For the wired-bus, \(I^2C\) will be used. \(I^2C\) addressing will
   be done manually for each slave connected to the bus. Data will be
   sent from master to slaves via the JSON format.

** Block Function Description
*** Raspberry Pi 2 (RPi2)
    The RPi2 has an Arch Linux ARM operating system. It is responsible
    for processing camera information from the PS3 Eye. It is also
    responsible for being the Networker, which transfers information
    between the wired and wireless buses.

    wave to the vehicle's motor.

    [[./figure/2019-11-06_dyns2211_photo.png]]

*** Power Supply
    Takes the 12v input from the battery and steps the voltage down to
    5v to power the vehicle's systems. Also provides current and
    voltage monitoring.  This module is designed and built as part of
    this project (see section [[#sec:powerSupplyDesign]] for details).

   [[./figure/2019-11-05_pidBlockDiagram.png]]

   A PID controller can be used to correct the steering of an
   autonomous vehicle. Given a vehicle with the task of following a
   line or path, the vehicle must be able to detect the path as well
   as where it is in relation to the path. The difference can be
   taken from these two pieces of information to form the cross-track
   error. The cross-track error will be sent as the input to the PID
   --- in figure [[fig:pidBlockDiagram]], the cross-track error is denoted
   \(e(t)\). 

   The PID has three control terms that are summed together to get a
   control variable output. Proportional control allows the vehicle to
   steer harder when it is further from the path. Derivative control
   induces a resistance to the pull from the proportional control;
   this brings the car smoothly back to the path in a timely manner
   while reducing the chance that the vehicle will overshoot the path
   due to the proportional control. Finally, the integral control
   corrects for external effects such as wind and terrain. 

   Each of these controls rely on a properly tuned PID. To tune a PID,
   each control term has a gain which must be adjusted until the
   system is stable. Such details will not be covered in this
   document.

** Experimental Setup
   #+name: fig:pidExperimentalSetup
   #+caption: The Arduino provides microsecond PWM values from 800 to 2200\(\mu s\) to the servo. The servo reacts to an error value via a software PID controller. Since there is nothing in this setup that generates a true error value, error values must either be simulated or retrieved from a feedback sensor (such as a camera). The values along the circumference are microsecond values that correspond to the servo position; they help verify the accuracy of the PID.

** Software Design
   All code in this section was compiled using the avr-g++ tool, and
   using C++17. Test code was compiled with g++ as opposed to avr-g++.

*** USART to Command the Servo from a Terminal Emulator
    In order to talk to the servo, we need to set up the USART on the
    AVR microcontroller. We will only show the code for a basic USART
    setup. Since the USART is only being used for experimental
    purposes only, we will not explain the code. For reference of how
    the code was used in our experiment, see the =main.c= file in the
    code appendix section [[#sec:appendixCode_steeringPid_main]].

*** Servo Control 
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: sec:softwareDesign_servoControl
    :END:
    To control the position of the servo, the attmega328p has a 16-bit
    timer. Once we set up the timer, we can provide it a pulse
    duration between the accepted values of the servo (typically
    1-2\(\si{ms}\)).

    The code for the servo is at the register level. Ideally, one
    should use a hardware abstraction layer (HAL) to avoid writing
    production code at a register level. In our =main.cpp= file, we
    have the following to set up our servo.

    #+name: code:servoSetup
    #+attr_latex: :options bgcolor=code
    #+BEGIN_SRC C++
#include <avr/io.h>

static constexpr uint32_t hertzToCycles(uint16_t hertz) {
    return clockFrequency/prescaler/hertz;
}

static void setupServoPwm() {
	DDRB |= 1 << PINB1; //Set pin 9 on arduino to output

	TCCR1A |=
        1 << WGM11 | //PWM Mode 14 (1/3)
        1 << COM1A0 | //Inverting Mode (1/2)
        1 << COM1A1; //Inverting Mode (2/2)
    
	TCCR1B |=
        1 << WGM12 | //PWM Mode 14 (2/3)
        1 << WGM13 | //PWM Mode 14 (3/3)
        1 << CS11; //Prescaler: 8

    //50Hz PWM to cycles for servo
	ICR1 = hertzToCycles(pwmFrequency)-1;
}
    #+END_SRC
    The servo uses the MCU's 16-bit Timer/Counter1 with PWM. It is
    connected to pin 9 on the Arduino Uno (port B, pin 1).

    #+name: fig:attmega16BitTimer_blockDiagram
    #+caption: ICRn stores the number of cycles needed for a 50Hz PWM signal for the servo. OCRnA stores the number of cycles until the counter reaches the TOP. OCRnA is used to change the pulse width of the PWM signal.
    #+attr_latex: :width 0.8\linewidth :placement [H]
    [[./figure/2019-11-06_attmega16BitTimer.png]]

    We also need to specify that we want to use Fast PWM Mode (resets
    counter when it reaches the TOP) and set ICR1 as the TOP. This
    corresponds to =mode 14=.

    #+name: fig:attmega16BitTimer_fastPwmMode
    #+caption: Shows the =WGM= flags needed for mode 14.
    #+attr_latex: :width 0.8\linewidth :placement [H]
    [[./figure/2019-11-06_attmega16BitTimer_fastPwmMode.png]]

    We do this on the register level by setting the =WGM= flags from
    figure [[fig:attmega16BitTimer_fastPwmMode]] in the =TCCRnA= and
    =TCCRnB= registers (as shown in the code above).

    Since the Arduino Uno uses a \(16\si{MHz}\) clock, we will need a
    prescaler to divide the frequency such that, 
    \[\frac{16\si{MHz}}{50\si{Hz}\cdot \texttt{prescaler}} < 2^{16}-1.\]

    \(50\si{MHz}\) is the needed frequency for the PWM signal for the
    servo and \(2^{16}-1\) is the maximum value that will fit in the
    =OCRnA= register (the size of an =int= on the attmega328p). If we
    set the prescaler to 8, the inequality above is true. We can do
    that by setting the =TCCRnB= register using the figure
    below. Setting this register for a prescaler of 8, looks like
    ~TCCR1B |= 1 << CS11~ (as shown in the code above).

    #+name: fig:attmega16BitTimer_prescaler
    #+caption: We are using a prescaler of 8, which corresponds to =CS1 = 0b010=.
    #+attr_latex: :width 0.8\linewidth :placement [H]
    [[./figure/2019-11-06_attmega16BitTimer_prescaler.png]]
    
    Finally, we can set the timer to inverted mode, meaning the pulse
    will occur at the end of the PWM period, as opposed to the
    beginning of the period. This is trivial for our application, but
    we still must choose either inverting or non-inverting. To set the
    timer to inverted we set the corresponding flags in the =TCCRnA=
    register, as ~TCCR1A |= 1 << COM1A0 | 1 << COM1A1~ (as shown in
    the code above).

    #+name: fig:attmega16BitTimer_invertingMode
    #+caption: We make sure to set the =COM1A1= and =COM1A0= flags in the =TCCRnA= register.

*** Clamping
    One common problem is providing a servo with a PWM value outside
    the valid range of the servo. For example, our servo has a maximum
    acceptable pulse width of 2200\(\mu s\). If we provide our servo
    with a pulse width 2300\(\mu s\), it could damage the servo. We
    will discuss a simple method for clamping the pulse widths
    provided to the servo. 

    The =Clamp= class looks as follows:
    
    #+attr_latex: :options bgcolor=code
    #+BEGIN_SRC C++
#ifndef CLAMP_HPP
#define CLAMP_HPP

#include <stdint.h>

struct Bounds {
    int16_t lower;
    int16_t upper;
};

class Clamp {
    Bounds bounds;

public:
    constexpr static Clamp makeFromBounds(Bounds bounds) {
        return Clamp(bounds);
    }

    constexpr Clamp(Bounds bounds): bounds{bounds} {}

    int16_t clamp(int16_t value) {
        return (value < bounds.lower) ? bounds.lower :
            (value > bounds.upper) ? bounds.upper:
            value;
    }

    Clamp() {}
};

#endif    
    #+END_SRC

    The class takes in a =Bounds= and uses the =clamp= member function
    to output a value between the upper and lower bounds. Since we are
    using this code on a microcontroller, we want an object of type
    =Clamp= to be initialized at compile-time. To do this we declare
    the constructor, and the static factory method, as =constexpr=. To
    ensure compile-time initialization, we must pass a constant
    expression or rvalue to either the static factory method or the
    constructor. 
    
    Here is a unit test suite, using CxxTest, for the =Clamp= class:
    #+attr_latex: :options bgcolor=code
    #+BEGIN_SRC C++
#include <cxxtest/TestSuite.h>
#include "Clamp.hpp"

class TestClamp: public CxxTest::TestSuite {
    Clamp clamp;
    Bounds bounds;
    
public:
    void setUp() {
        bounds = {
            .lower = 10,
            .upper = 20
        };
        
        clamp = Clamp::makeFromBounds(bounds);
    }
    
    void test_inputAboveUpper_clampsToUpper() {
        int16_t expected = bounds.upper;
        int16_t actual = clamp.clamp(25);
        TS_ASSERT_EQUALS(actual, expected);
    }

    void test_inputBelowLower_clampsToLower() {
        int16_t expected = bounds.lower;
        int16_t actual = clamp.clamp(5);
        TS_ASSERT_EQUALS(actual, expected);
    }

    void test_inputBetweenBounds_noClamp() {
        int16_t expected = 15;
        int16_t actual = clamp.clamp(15);
        TS_ASSERT_EQUALS(actual, expected);
    }
};
    #+END_SRC

    Each =test_= function in the test suite demonstrates the
    functionality of the =Clamp= class. It also includes the way we
    recommend instantiating the =Clamp= class. That is, by using the
    static factory method as opposed to the constructor.
    #+attr_latex: :options bgcolor=code
    #+BEGIN_SRC C++
clamp = Clamp::makeFromBounds({
        .lower = 10,
        .upper = 20 });
    #+END_SRC

    This is purely for readability, so the reader can understand
    that a =Clamp= object requires a =Bounds=.

    Again, after instantiating the =Clamp= class, you can use it as,
    #+BEGIN_SRC C++
int16_t clampedValue = clamp.clamp(5); // Returns 10 since the lower bound is 10.
    #+END_SRC
 
*** PID
    As discussed in section [[#sec:steeringPid_concept]], a PID will
    provide reactive control to the servo from error feedback. In our
    system, the camera detects lanes. The further the car is from
    being centered between those lanes, the greater the error that is
    input into our steering PID. We've encapsulated the algorithm for
    a PID in a class.
    
    #+attr_latex: :options bgcolor=code
    #+BEGIN_SRC C++
#ifndef PID_HPP
#define PID_HPP

#include <stdint.h>

struct Pid {
    struct Component {
        int16_t proportional;
        int16_t integral;
        int16_t derivative;
    };

private:    
    Component gain;
    Component error;
    int16_t scale;
    
public:
    int16_t updateError(int16_t error);
    
    constexpr static Pid makeFromGain(Component gain) {
        return Pid(gain);
    }
    
    constexpr explicit Pid(Component gain):
        gain{gain}, error{}, scale{1} {}

    
    constexpr static Pid makeFromScaledGain(int16_t scale, Component gain) {
        return Pid(scale, gain);
    }
    
    constexpr Pid(int16_t scale, Component gain):
        gain{gain}, error{}, scale{scale} {}

    Pid() {}
};

#endif
    #+END_SRC

    The PID takes in a structure of gains (proportional, integral, and
    derivative). Then, when =updateError= is called, it will return
    the control variable output of the PID. 

    Since we may have gains that are decimal values, and assuming we
    don't want to do floating point arithmetic on a microcontroller,
    we've included a scale variable which divides the final output of
    the PID. This means if we provide a gain value of =1= (for one of
    the control gains) and a scale of =10=, then we equivalently have
    a gain value of =1/10=. To get this behavior, we use the
    =makeFromScaleGain= to instantiate the =Pid= class, instead of
    =makeFromGain=.

    The definition of the =updateError= function is
    #+BEGIN_SRC C++
int16_t Pid::updateError(int16_t newError) {
    error.integral += newError;
    error.derivative = newError - error.proportional;
    error.proportional = newError;

    return (gain.proportional*error.proportional +
            gain.integral*error.integral +
            gain.derivative*error.derivative) / scale ;    
}
    #+END_SRC

    Notice the result is divided by scale, as discussed
    above. Furthermore, we've provided a unit test that demonstrates
    how to use this class.

    #+attr_latex: :options bgcolor=code
    #+BEGIN_SRC C++
#include <cxxtest/TestSuite.h>
#include "Pid.hpp"

class TestPid: public CxxTest::TestSuite {
public:
    void test_errorInput_returnsCorrectedOutput() {
        Pid pid = Pid::makeFromGain({
                .proportional = 1,
                .integral = 2,
                .derivative = 3 });
        
        int16_t actual = pid.updateError(2);
        int16_t expected = 12;

        TS_ASSERT_EQUALS(actual, expected);
    }

    void test_scaledGain() {
        int16_t scale = 100;
        
        Pid pid = Pid::makeFromScaledGain(scale, {
                .proportional = 100,
                .integral = 200,
                .derivative = 300 });
        
        int16_t actual = pid.updateError(2);
        int16_t expected = 12;

        TS_ASSERT_EQUALS(actual, expected);
    }
};    
    #+END_SRC

    Ideally, the user would call =updateError= iteratively though.
*** USART PID Results
    The =main.cpp= code in the code appendix section
    [[#sec:appendixCode_steeringPid_main]] depcits the general flow of the
    program. Ultimately, the Arduino asks for an initial position for
    the servo (in microseconds), and then the servo will go to that
    position. After a short delay, the PID will begin updating its
    control variable output in a for loop. That control variable
    output is directly used to position the servo. For debugging
    purposes, the Arduino also sends the PID control variable output
    over USART, so we can see the values the PID is giving. 

    The figure below illustrates an example where I send the servo to
    \(800\si{\mu s}\), and then the PID corrects the servo's position
    to \(1500\si{\mu s}\).

    #+name: fig:steeringPid_usartLog

#+caption: 3D Render of Power Supply

[[./figure/pcb_3d_render.PNG]]

The function of the power supply is to step down the 12v (nominal) battery voltage to 5v
for powering the vehicle's systems. The power supply is designed to be capable of outputting
3A with a 9v input (9v is the lowest safe charge for a 3-cell LiPo battery). The system should
use much less than 3A on average, but a 3A output provides a large margin of error. The power supply
is also capable of measuring the battery voltage and battery current draw and reporting these values
over the I2C bus.

** Switching Regulator

The power supply is implemented using a TI LM2596SM-5.0 buck switching regulator. The switching regulator section of the power 
supply consists of C1, C2, L1, D1 and U2 in the schematic diagram.
A switching regulator is used instead of a linear regulator (ex. 7805) for efficiency reasons. A linear regulator has an 
efficiency of about 40% with a 12v input, whereas a buck converter will have an efficiency of about 80-90%.
A linear regulator also produces a large amount of heat, which would require a large heatsink.

#+caption: Power Supply Schematic
#+attr_latex: :width \linewidth :placement [H]
[[./figure/schematic.PNG]]

The regulator operates in a buck configuration, in continuous mode (the inductor current never falls to zero).
A buck regulator operates in two cycles, shown in [[fig:buck_diagram]]. The switching regulator IC (U2) acts as the
switch. When the switch is closed, the inductor charges and produces an opposing voltage. This reduces the voltage
across the load (following KVL). When the switch opens again, the inductor acts as a current source and discharges
through the load. This switching creates voltage spikes, so the output capacitor is used to smooth them out. The output
voltage is controlled by varying the ratio of switch on time vs off time.

#+caption: Buck Converter Cycles
#+name: fig:buck_diagram
#+attr_latex: :width 0.5 \linewidth :placement [H]
[[./figure/buck_diagram.png]]

The capacitors used for the switching section, C1 and C2 are both low ESR (equivalent series resistance) electrolytics.
Low ESR capacitors are used so that they are capable of handling high current spikes without overheating. The inductor has a 
value of 330uH, which allows the regulator to operate in continuous mode to improve efficiency. The specific inductor (Bourns
SRP1038C-330M) was chosen because it is capable of handling 4A of DC current and has a saturation current of 6A. A saturation 
current of over 3A is needed for the regulator to operate, there were issues with the prototype where the inductor was 
saturating at about 2A and causing the output voltage to go out of regulation. The diode D1 is a 50WQ04 Shottky diode,
which was chosen because of its low forward voltage and fast recovery. Fast recovery is important because the regulator 
switches at 150kHz and a standard silicon diode would not switch fast enough. 

** Power Measurement

#+caption: INA226 Pinout
#+attr_latex: :width 0.5 \linewidth :placement [H]
[[./figure/ina226.png]]

A TI INA226 power monitor IC is used to measure the total power used by the system. This IC measures the total system power
by measuring the input voltage and the voltage across a shunt resistor. The shunt resistor (shown as Rsense in the schematic)
is connected in series with the input of the switching regulator to provide a more accurate reading. The resistor has a value of
0.002 ohm, and the current flowing through it can be calculated using Ohm's law. 

The INA226 communicates using I2C and provides current, voltage and power measurements as well as the voltage across the shunt
resistor. It also supports alerts over I2C and a dedicated digital output. The INA226 will be connected into the system wide
wired-bus with an I2C address of 0x40. The power and voltage measurements will be used to calculate the remaining battery life, 
and the voltage measurement will be used to allow the system to put the car into a safe state before the battery is empty.

** PCB Design

A PCB (printed circuit board) was designed for the power supply to provide more physical durability, as well as more stability
for the buck converter. Since the buck converter operates at 150kHz traces connecting the inductor, output capacitor and diode
need to be as thick and short as possible. The back side of the board uses copper fill as a ground plane to keep the impedance
to ground as low as possible, and to act as a heatsink for the LM2596. Multiple vias are placed under the LM2596 to help with
thermal and electrical conductivity. Surface mount components are used to keep leads short and make the finished product as compact as possible. Since the board will be hand soldered, larger pads are used for all components.


#+caption: PCB Layout
#+attr_latex: :width 0.5 \linewidth :placement [H]
[[./figure/pcb_2d_render.PNG]]

The PCB and schematic were designed in KiCad, and while component footprints were available for most parts there was nothing
matching the inductor so a custom footprint was made. The custom footprint was designed in the KiCad component editor. 
The component's datasheet was referenced for the size and spacing of the solder pads. The solder pads were widened and 
lengthened slightly to allow for easier hand soldering, although the spacing between them remains unchanged. Two 2.1 mm diameter
mounting holes are included in the layout.

The power input and output connectors are 5mm pitch terminal blocks, in addition to a USB output port. The terminal blocks
were picked because they are capable of accepting a 20 to 12 AWG wire which will allow more flexibility when connecting the 
power supply into the system. The battery will be directly connected to the input terminals, the Raspberry Pi will be connected
to the USB port (with a small microUSB cable) and all other 5v devices will be connected to the output terminals. The I2C 
signals from the INA226 are routed to a pin header, with pull up resistors.

** Testing

To test the power supply, the setup shown below will be used. The voltmeters and ammeters are used to measure the current and
voltage at the input and output of the power supply. The potentiometer (or decade resistance box) will be used to place a load
on the system. The bench power supply can be used to test the range of input voltages, and an oscilloscope can be placed across 
the power supply's (DUT) terminals to measure the ripple on the output.

#+caption: Test Setup
#+attr_latex: :width 0.8 \linewidth :placement [H]
[[./figure/test_diagram.png]]

The switching regulator will be tested first by providing 12.6v to the input, which is the batteries maximum voltage. Then the load on 
the output will be increased from 0A to 3A in 0.5A steps, and the input and output voltages and currents will be recorded, along 
with the peak-to-peak ripple. This will then be repeated with an input voltage of 12.0v 11v 10v and 9v which will simulate the 
full range of battery voltages. These tests will ensure that the switching regulator is capable of providing the required output
at all possible battery voltages.

Next, the power measurement section will be tested and calibrated. An Arduino will be connected to the I2C terminals on the 
power supply, and a simple sketch will be used to report the measured voltage, current and power over the serial console.
The bench power supply will be adjusted until it is outputting exactly 10v, and then the difference between the measured and
actual voltage will be found to get a calibration factor. Next, the power supply will be loaded until the input current is
exactly 1.0A. Then the difference between the measured and actual current will be found to find a calibration factor.
The calibration factors will then be written into the calibration registers on the INA226.
