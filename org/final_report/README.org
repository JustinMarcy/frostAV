* Evaluation and Analysis
** Requirements Evaluation
The main problem-domain requirements for this project are:
   1. Given a _lane_, the car must travel approximately parallel to it,
      such that the car stays within its _boundaries_ consistently,
      and, if the car is to accidentally leave it, it promptly
      returns.
   2. Given a _corner_, the car must turn, continuing from the carâ€™s
      current _lane_ to the next, such that the car stays within its
      _boundaries_ consistently, and, if the car is to accidentally
      leave it, it promptly returns.
   3. Given an _obstacle_, the car must stop until it is moved
      further from the car, or it is removed from _circuit boundaries_.
   4. Given a _sign_, the car must respond to the event provided by it.
   5. Given a _circuit_, the car must complete a full loop.
