* Test Environment
In order to test the overall system, the car will be placed on a designated circuit.
The circuit will be created, with the lane edges defined by tape with a width less than 2 inches.
The lanes need to be wider than the width of the car.
The circuit will have at least one sign, printed onto paper and placed perpendicular to the floor.
Each corner of the circuit must be less than 45Â°.
There will also be automated obstacles placed onto the course which will force the car to stop, and then they will be automatically removed.

* Test requirements
The car must be able to travel in a lane, approximately parallel to it an remain within its boundaries.
If the car leaves the lane then it must promptly return to it.
When the car reaches a corner, the car must turn, following the lane boundaries consistently.
When presented with an obstacle the car must stop until it is moved away from the car's path.
The car must be able to complete a full loop of the circuit.

* Module Testing
As the car is assembled, each module will be tested individually to ensure that they function as intended.
