The intention of this document is not to over-constrain the
development of Frost; rather, it provides a framework for which a
minimally working autonomous vehicle can emerge. This document does
not take precedence over the [[https://agilemanifesto.org/][Agile Manifesto]], and should not interfere
with the use of the [[https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum][Scrum]] framework.
