Performance Requirements

1. The total power consumption of the design cannot exceed the maximum capacity of the batteries. 

2. The design must be transferable to any similar sized RC car without modifying the servo or motor.

3. The car must not move outside the track more than 3 times per lap.
   Definintion: When all four tires are outside the marked edge, the car is considered off track.

4. The car must identify multiple road signs using optical character recognition and react accordingly.

5. In the event of a stop sign, the car must wait exactly 5 seconds before proceeding.

6. In the event of a SLOW sign, the car must reduce its current speed by 50%.

8. In the event of an obstacle, the car must stop and wait until the obstacle is removed.
   Definition: If the car touches the obstacle, then it fails this requirement.

9. The minimum stopping distance for obstacle collision is 2 inches. 

10. The embedded linux system, as well as all other controllers,
    shall cumminicate using a shared I2C bus.

11. The car power must be independently supplied using two 3-cell lithium ion batteries.
