The finished product for the Automated Car project must be capable of
navigating a test circuit which contains lanes, corners and signs. The
car needs to travel within the lane provided and recover when it
leaves the lane.The car
must be able to recognize and follow signs, and stop for
obstacles until they are removed from the circuit.
The system should be minimally invasive (ex. not using encoders
or speed sensors built into the car) so that it can easily be adapted
to other car platforms. The car should be able to repeatedly follow the circuit.
While turning, the car must be able to maintain its lane and return if it accidentaly leaves it.
