The system should be capable of controlling the car without any
sensors built into the car chassis itself (no encoders, speed sensors,
etc.) The main navigation system should run on embedded Linux, and
interface with the car using an AVR or similar microcontroller. The
car use two cameras in a stereo configuration, along
with an IMU (accelerometer and gyroscope) for navigating the course.
