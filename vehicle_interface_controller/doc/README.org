* [1/2] Tasks
  - [5/5] *Makefile Organization* 11/19/2019
    1. [X] Build Makefile.conf including contents of current top-level Makefile.
       + Edit: split configurations into 'mk' directory .mk files (e.g. rules.mk, toolchain.mk)
    2. [X] Redo current top-level Makefile to call all subdirectory makefiles 
    3. [X] Build Makefile for 'sweep' application code
    4. [X] Figure out way to include common library among application code.
    5. [X] Test that the top-level Makefile calls 'sweep' Makefile
  - [3/4] *AVR C++ Code for Speed Controller Sweeping* 11/19/2019
    1. [X] Setup motor test with Pololu Speed Controller
       - Use RC car speed controller if this one does not work.
    2. [X] Test with Arduino that Servo library works with the speed controller.
    3. [X] Write AVR C++ register-level code for speed controller.
    4. [ ] Generalize Servo and Speed Controller register-level code.
  - [X] *Multiple PWM Devices (servo, ESC) Using Same Timer* 11/20/2019
  - [ ] *Use Makefile Defined FCPU Instead of Passing Clock Frequency to usart* 11/22/2019
